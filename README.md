# ðŸš€ How it works?
- Takes input from the user, a song name, just like you search on spotify or youtube
- Searches the given song by name (via Spotify) means that the program picks song name and artist from spotify
- Streams audio by searching the song and artist on YouTube and then playing the music using the `mpv`
- Control playback using arrow keys
- Clean, readable CLI interface

# Get CLIENT_SECRET AND CLIENT_ID from Spotify api
- Step 1: Go to [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), there click on create app.
- Step 2: Enter the required details, like app name, app description, you can enter anything you want
- Step 3: In the redirect urls, enter anything like google.com or anything, doesnt matter much, or even put the github link of this repo
- Step 4: At the bottom, it will ask you which APIs you want to use, select Web API.
- Step 5: Click Save

After the app has been created, copy the Client ID and Client Secret

Then in the root directory, create a `.env` file, and add the fields CLIENT_ID = (one you copied) and CLIENT_SECRET = (one you copied)
